    "## Description of the flow problem\n",
    "Consider two-dimensional flow in a semi-infinite confined aquifer. For modeling purposes, the aquifer extends from $x=0$ to $x=L$ in the $x$ direction, where $L$ is chosen far enough away not to effect the solution. The aquifer consists of a sand layer covered on top and bottom by a clay layer. The sand layer is modeled with 10 model layers and each clay layer is modeled with 5 model layers. \n",
    "Water is injected in the sand layer at the left side at a rate $U$, equally divided over the model layers. \n",
    "The head is fixed on the right side of the model to $h_R$ in all layers. All other model boundaries are impermeable to flow of both water and energy. Flow is considered to be at steady state instantaneously. \n",
    "The initial temperature is $T_\\text{init}$ everywhere. Injection of warmer water with temperature $T_\\text{inj}$ starts at $t=0$ and lasts for $t_\\text{in}$ days. Buoyancy and viscosity changes are not considered as the temperature differences are small."

    "This model is a better approximation of a real system than the one-dimensional flow problem of the previous notebook. As we saw, a significant amount of energy is lost through conduction into the overlying and underlying clay layers. Bear in mind, this model is still approximate. Some of the approximations are:\n",
    "* The top of the upper clay layer and the bottom of the lower clay layer are impermeable for energy (and water) while some energy will likely be lost through those boundaries.\n",
    "* The solution will likely change some when smaller cell sizes and time steps are used.\n",
    "* The flow into the sand layer is equally distributed over the thickness (although this is probably quite reasonable, as the hydraulic conductivity of the clay layer is very small compared to the sand layer).\n",
    "* The thermal parameters of the solids of the sand and clay are taken equal here for simplicity.\n",
